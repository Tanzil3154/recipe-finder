## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow ES6+ syntax conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and components
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Use proper prop validation where applicable

### CSS

- Use component-scoped CSS files
- Follow BEM naming convention where appropriate
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
- Ensure responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Test on different screen sizes

### File Structure

- Place new components in `src/components/`
- Each component should have its own CSS file
- Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `MyComponent.jsx`)
- Use kebab-case for CSS files (e.g., `my-component.css`)

## üîß Development Workflow
